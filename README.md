# Summary

I love games, so this application was super fun to write and is also my first game application. Although it is super simple in design and graphics, there were many obstacles to clear when writing the snake movement algorithm.

# Game Rules

Control the snake movement using keyboard arrow keys. Eat the apple to grow your snake. If the snake collides with wall, game over. Points are earned for apples eaten. See how high you can score... Enjoy!
